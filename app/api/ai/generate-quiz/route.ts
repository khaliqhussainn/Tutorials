QUESTION QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. AVOID basic recall questions like "What is X?" or "Which of the following..."
2. CREATE questions that test:
   - Deep understanding and conceptual connections
   - Practical application and problem-solving
   - Critical thinking and analysis
   - Real-world scenarios and use cases
   - Common misconceptions and edge cases

3. DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION: ${difficulty === 'mixed' ? '2 easy, 2 medium, 1 hard' : `All ${difficulty}`}

4. QUESTION TYPES TO INCLUDE:
   - Scenario-based: "Given situation X, what would be the best approach and why?"
   - Problem-solving: "If you encountered [specific problem], how would you solve it using concepts from this lesson?"
   - Comparative: "When would you use approach A vs approach B in real practice?"
   - Synthesis: "How do the concepts in this lesson connect to [related topic]?"
   - Application: "In a professional setting, how would you apply this knowledge?"

5. MAKE DISTRACTORS (wrong answers) plausible but clearly incorrect to experts
6. ENSURE each question is unique and tests different aspects
7. AVOID overlapping or repetitive content

EXAMPLE QUESTION PATTERNS:
- "A developer is building [specific scenario]. What's the most effective approach and why?"
- "When implementing [concept from video], what's the most critical consideration for [real context]?"
- "Which approach would be most suitable for [specific use case] and what are the trade-offs?"

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON only):
[
  {
    "question": "Detailed scenario-based question that tests real understanding",
    "options": [
      "Comprehensive correct answer with specific reasoning",
      "Plausible but incorrect option with common misconception",
      "Another realistic but wrong approach",
      "Third believable but incorrect solution"
